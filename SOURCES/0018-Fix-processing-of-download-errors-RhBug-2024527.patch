Subject: [PATCH] Fix processing of download errors (RhBug: 2024527)

Users with different than english locale are not able to update their
systems in case that some of updates are already downloaded in the dnf
cache (e.g. using dnf-automatic).

The error string is taken from librepo target where it is stored
untranslated. Therefore we need to compare untranslated versions of the
string.
